# Portfolio
Welcome to a list of my personal projects and contributions. I started learning how to program after attending International Nodebots Day 2015 at the [757 Makerspace](http://757makerspace.com) in Norfolk, VA. I received my first Nodebot and was hooked. Since then, I have been on a never ending quest to learn as much as I can about web technologies.

## Ghostbusters Marketing Website
My first project after finishing html/css/js basics. I pretended that the Ghostbusters hired me to create a slick marketing website for them. 

In this project I learned how to: 
* Use Bootstrap
* Modify an HTML template
* Host a Static Site
* Use git and Github

## Ghost Reporter App
The Ghostbusters loved the marketing site so much, that they wanted me to create an app that let's anyone report ghost sightings. This was a huge challenge for me to take on. It quickly taught me how to expand my skills to to the back end using  NodeJS with a database.

In this project I learned how to: 
* Deploy an app to Heroku
* Use MongoDB
* Use Jade templates

UPDATED: I wanted to learn some React, so I built a new version with React and [deployed](https://ghostreporter-react-lxuotvklmv.now.sh/) it to Zeit's Now. There is also a [version](https://ghostreact.firebaseapp.com/) built with Firebase.

In the update I learned: 
* New deployment methods
* Firebase
* React

## Deletion
This was my first Code&Art project. I wanted to create an app that highlights the ephemeral nature of digital thought. While it is true that nothing on the internet dies, it is easier now than ever to make something completely impermanent. All you have to do is delete it from memory and pull the power. In this experiment I invite the viewer to sit at a blank screen and just type whatever they want. 

Eventually, I would like to have it become an installation where it's a darkened room that is empty except for a keyboard on a pedestal. The screen is projected on an empty wall. Other thoughts I had were to introduce random music and lights to affect the mood of the viewer to see if it changes what they write and their overall experience.

In this project I learned how to: 
* Develop a concept into working code
* Store user input in an array and manipulate the array
* Actually delete the first character on a timer! 
* Display the results
* Use JQuery

## Random Carry
I am a volunteer and member of Babywearing International of Hampton Roads. It's an educational and community outreach organization that teaches caregivers the tools of babywearing. Babywearing is a huge part of how I parent, and I wanted to give back something. I created this app during Babywearing Week to promote the cause. In a couple of days, I figured out how to convert a huge excel spreadsheet of wrap sizes and carry types to generate a random carry for caregivers. When I orginally wanted to make an app, I came up with really wild ideas. However, after actually asking the community what they wanted, they told me that they just needed something to help them choose what carry to do on any given day. Thus, random carry was created. 

In this project I learned how to: 
* Listen to user needs
* Work with JSON as a data model 
* Create business logic that fit the user needs
