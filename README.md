# Portfolio
Welcome to a list of my personal projects and contributions. I started learning how to program after attending International Nodebots Day 2015 at the 757 Makerspace in Norfolk, VA. I received my first Nodebot and was hooked. Since then, I have been on a never ending quest to learn as much as I can about web technologies.

## Ghostbusters Marketing Website
My first project after finishing html/css/js basics. I pretended that the Ghostbusters hired me to create a slick marketing website for them. 

In this project I learned how to: 
* Use Bootstrap
* Modify an HTML template
* Host a Static Site
* Use git and Github

## Ghost Reporter App
The Ghostbusters loved the marketing site so much, that they wanted me to create an app that let's anyone report ghost sightings. This was a huge challenge for me to take on. It quickly taught me how to expand my skills to to the back end using  NodeJS with a database.

In this project I learned how to: 
* Deploy an app to Heroku
* Use MongoDB
* Use Jade templates

UPDATED: I wanted to learn some React, so I built a new version with React and [deployed](https://ghostreporter-react-lxuotvklmv.now.sh/) it to Zeit's Now. There is also a [version](https://ghostreact.firebaseapp.com/) built with Firebase.

In the update I learned: 
* New deployment methods
* Firebase
* React

## Deletion
This was my first Code&Art project. I wanted to create an app that highlights the ephemeral nature of digital thought. While it is true that nothing on the internet dies, it is easier now than ever to make something completely impermanent. All you have to do is delete it from memory and pull the power. In this experiment I invite the viewer to sit at a blank screen and just type whatever they want.
