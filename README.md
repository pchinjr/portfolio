# Portfolio
Welcome to a list of my personal projects and contributions. I started learning how to program after attending International Nodebots Day 2015 at the 757 Makerspace in Norfolk, VA. I received my first Nodebot and was hooked. Since then, I have been on a never ending quest to learn as much as I can about web technologies. 

## Ghostbusters Marketing Website
My first project after finishing html/css/js basics. I pretended that the Ghostbusters hired me to create a slick marketing website for them. 

In this project I learned how to: 
* Use Bootstrap
* Modify an HTML template
* Host a Static Site
